        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> Pampanga is labeled the culinary capital of the Philippines for its delicious classic recipes and rich food culture.burong Kapampangan are some of the Kapampangan dishes that have not only marked the local culinary scene, but have also placed the country on the global food map. One of the dishes that Pampanga is famous for is called burong Kapampangan. Burong Kapampangan is a recipe that has been passed through generations. Buro is a Tagalog word for preserved, fermented, or pickled. Burong Kapampangan is a form of fermented rice with fish or small shrimps. This is a great side dish for fried fish (especially Dalag and Dalagang Bukid), steamed vegetables (Mustasa, Sigarilyas) and Sinigang na Isda sa Miso. However, this native delicacy is not for the fainthearted or should I say “faintstomached”. lol The look, the taste and above all, the smell of this dish can make or break one’s appetite..</p>

            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
                
                    <li>Cook Rice: Cook rice until slightly overdone and sticky. Let it cool until warm but not hot.</li>
                    <li>Layer Rice and Shrimp Paste: In a clean jar, layer the cooked rice with shrimp paste. Optional: Add crushed garlic, sliced ginger, and chili peppers between the layers for extra flavor.</li>
                    <li>Press Down and Seal: Press down the mixture to remove air pockets and ensure rice is submerged in shrimp paste. Seal the jar tightly.</li>
                    <li>Fermentation: Let the jar ferment at room temperature for 3-5 days. Flavors will develop, and the mixture will become tangy and slightly sour.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate: After fermentation, refrigerate Buro to slow down fermentation and prolong shelf life.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy: Serve as a condiment or side dish with fried or grilled meats, fish, or vegetables.</li>
