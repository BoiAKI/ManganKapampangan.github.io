        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> 
            As any Filipino mother will tell you, the magic of lugaw comes in its restorative properties. This recipe, adapted from the version served at Uncle Mike's Place, a diner in Chicago, is not supposed to be a wallop of flavors. Approach it as a savory oatmeal, with notes of ginger and chicken peeking through the warm, soothing creaminess. The key is constant stirring during the first 10 minutes of cooking, which aids in breaking down the starches in the rice and makes for a thicker, more luscious dish
