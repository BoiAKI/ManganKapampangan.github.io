        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> 
                This is the Filipino version of the meat loaf, which we most probably got from the Spaniards, the recipe for which has been improved by Pampanga’s Best.   Unlike the American meat loaf, however, our embutido is a meat roll usually made of ground pork blended with spices, Pampanga’s Best’s unique seasoning, carrots, sausages, and whole boiled eggs.  You can serve it as a breakfast item or as a lunch or dinner viand, either fried or sliced straight from the roll.

                        <li>1 cup onion, grated/minced</li>
                        <li>2 cloves garlic, grated/minced</li>
                        <li>½ cup minced red bell pepper or green bell pepper</li>
                        <li>½ cup pickle relish</li>
                        <li>¼ cup raisins</li>
                        <li>4 large eggs</li>
                        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
                        <li>1 cup grated cheese</li>
                        <li>Salt, pepper, liquid seasoning, to taste</li>
                        <li>For Wrapper: Aluminum Foil</li>

            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
                      
                    
                            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients until well incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Season with salt, pepper, and liquid seasoning to taste and mix well. Freeze it for 15 minutes to make the mixture firm and for easy handling. Don't freeze too much, just enough for it not to be too saggy.</li>
                            <li>Divide this mixture into 4-5 portions.</li>
                            <li>Prepare 4-5 pieces of equal size foil (large square foil), spread and flatten the mixture onto the center of each foil and form a flat square mixture.</li>
                            <li>Hold the foil onto your hand and roll until the ends of the mixture form into a log.</li>
                            <li>Roll the aluminum foil into a tightly packed log about 2 inches in diameter, sealing on both ends. Repeat with the remaining pork mixture.</li>
                            <li>Prepare a steamer and bring it to a boil.</li>
                            <li>Place the embutido in a steamer and steam for an hour over low heat.</li>
                            <li>Let it cool and store in the fridge before serving.</li>
