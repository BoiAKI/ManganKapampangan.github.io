        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> 
                Pindang Babi is a Filipino cured pork dish from Pampanga prepared with sugar and salt cured fermented preserved pork strips. During the old days where refrigeration was not yet invented this is how pork was preserved in Pampanga where pork strips are fermented with rice and salt placed in an earthenware jar then dug under a dirt for long periods, this was called Buro, and the dish it created was Burong Babi. The rice effectively ferments the pork while the salt cures and preserves it. After meat was fermented it was cooked by frying them in lard or oil.

        <h2>RECIPE</h2>
        <ul>
            

                
                
           <li>1 kg pork scotch, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick pieces then into thick strips</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pink curing salt / Prague powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh Pineapple Juice</li>

            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
                      
                    
         <li>In a bowl, combine all marinade ingredients, mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the pork strips, making sure they are all coated with the marinade. Place in a container with a tight seal and keep in the refrigerator for three to five days to cure and ferment.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to cook the meat, remove it from the refrigerator two hours prior to cooking. Then, fry initially in very low heat for 3 minutes on each side to prevent the sugar from burning fast. Increase the heat to medium and continue to fry for 2 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and freshly chopped tomatoes.</li>
