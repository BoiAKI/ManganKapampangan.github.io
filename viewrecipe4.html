        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> Bringhe is the Filipino adaptation of the Spanish paella, rumored to have come from the northern region of Pampanga. Our local version is made with glutinous rice that has been boiled in coconut milk and turmeric powder, which gives it a unique flavor and color, unlike the latter, which is made with bomba or arborio rice scented with saffron. Without Bringhe on the menu, a Kapampangan party or celebration is incomplete. In Tarlac, I always looked forward to fiestas, holidays, and birthdays because there would be a large pot of this paella prepared in the Filipino way to savor.</p>

            <li>1 (16 ounce) can coconut milk</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="camaru-procedure">
            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In a wide, thick-bottomed skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add chorizo de bilbao and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 4 to 5 minutes or until color changes and lightly browned. Remove from pan and set aside. In the pan, heat another tablespoon of oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
                <li>Add rice and cook, stirring regularly, for about 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly toasted.</li>
                <li>Add fish sauce and continue to cook for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add the coconut milk, broth, chicken, chorizo de bilbao, julienned carrots, bell peppers, green peas, and raisins.</li>
                <li>Add turmeric powder and stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Cover the rice mixture with banana leaves, cover the pan with lid, and continue to cook for about 15 to 20 minutes or until rice is fully cooked and liquid is absorbed.</li>
                <li>If you like to toast the bottom, transfer the rice to a wide pan lined with banana leaves, cover with banana leaves, and cook on medium heat until it forms "socarrat" (crust). Flip the rice so the toasted bottom goes to the top and continue to cook to again form a crust.</li>
                <li>To serve, garnish with red and green bell peppers, hardboiled eggs, and carrot
            </ul>
