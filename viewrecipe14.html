        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> 
                Pampanga, known as the 'Culinary Center of the Philippines', is home to a delicacy called taba ng talangka, made from the orange fat of hundreds of mini crabs shelled and gathered. This dish is considered the caviar of Filipinos and is often mixed with starch and talangka meat. However, the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption led to a decline in talangka, making it a rare catch in the area. The best bottled taba ng talangka is from Navarro's, a family-owned business that has been producing it since the 1970s. To make it, fry chopped garlic in oil, add a tablespoon or two of Navarro's (Taba ng Talangka) Premium, and add local limes. Mixing this with steamed white rice adds depth to any dish.

        <h2>RECIPE</h2>
        <ul>
            

                
                
                        <li>200 pieces talangka – female</li>
                        <li>20 pieces talangka – male</li>
                        <li>The total fat/meat must come to one cup</li>
                        <li>How to tell male from female – when one looks on the underside of the crab, one sees a flap under the crab. The females’ flap is heart shaped and the male is sword shaped. And the androgynous is in between the two; a thin heart.</li>
                        <li>¼ cup cooking oil</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons crushed garlic</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon calamansi juice</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon Mirin</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                      
                                                    
            
              
              
        </ul>

            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
                      
                    
                    
                            <li>In a small glass bowl, mix the fat/meat of the talangka with the calamansi juice and Mirin. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>In a non-reactive cooking saucepan (use a Teflon-coated or ceramic pan or glass cooking pan), warm the pan over low flame for 1 minute and pour in oil.</li>
                            <li>Warm for 1 minute and begin to sauté the garlic until the garlic is a light golden tan.</li>
                            <li>Throughout the whole cooking process, keep the fire low.</li>
                            <li>When the garlic is a light golden tan, pour in the crab/meat mixture.</li>
                            <li>Continuously stir the mixture slowly; you don’t want it to be pasty; you want some texture.</li>
                            <li>Season with pepper and continue to simmer until the cooking oil starts to color into a bright red-orange.</li>
                            <li>Taste the mixture and adjust. You can add more calamansi juice, Mirin, or black pepper and salt if needed.</li>
                            <li>This whole procedure takes about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                            <li>When done, cool the mixture and place it in a sterile container and refrigerate or you can freeze.</li>
                            <li>Eat with steaming hot rice or with crackers or use as a sauce.</li>
