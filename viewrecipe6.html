        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> 
            The history of Kare-Kare Kapampangan is deeply rooted in the culinary traditions of Pampanga, which is known as the "Culinary Capital of the Philippines." Traditionally, Kare-kare is made up of beef, oxtail, peanut sauce, and vegetables like eggplant, pechay, heart of banana and green beans. The perfect partner of kare-kare is the shrimp paste (also known as bagoong). In Pampanga, Kare-Kare has its own distinct version known as Kare-Kare Kapampangan. What sets it apart is the use of achuete (annatto) seeds, which give the dish its signature orange color, and the inclusion of more native vegetables like puso ng saging (banana blossom) and alugbati (Malabar spinach). Kare-Kare Kapampangan has become a beloved dish not only in Pampanga but also throughout the Philippines, often served during special occasions and celebrations as a symbol of Filipino culinary heritage and tradition
