        <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
        <p> 
            Besides their main dishes, Kapampangans also take their desserts seriously. One dessert that you should try when visiting Pampanga is tibuk-tibuk. This is Pampanga’s version of Maja Blanca that is traditionally made with carabao’s milk, with a hint of dayap zest (local lemon) with latik on top. Tibuk-tibuk or tibok is literally translated as “heart beat” that describes the bubbles pulsating up and down (that looks like a beating heart) when the pudding is cooked. We suggest you try Susie’s Cuisine’s version of the tibuk-tibuk, for that creamy, melt in your mouth goodness that tastes like heaven.

            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
            <ul>
            
                
                    <li>Prepare Coconut Cream: In a pan over medium heat, bring coconut cream to a boil. Cook until it thickens, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Simmer Coconut Cream: Lower the heat and simmer until oil separates and solids form, stirring regularly to prevent burning. Cook until curds turn golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Drain Latik: Use a fine mesh sieve or colander to drain the latik, reserving the oil.</li>
                    <li>Prepare Pan: Brush a 7 x 5-inch pan generously with coconut oil and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Prepare Milk Mixture: In a heavy-bottomed pot, combine milk, rice flour, sugar, and salt (if using cow's milk). Whisk until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Cook Milk Mixture: Over medium-low heat, bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking regularly. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until it thickens to a smooth paste.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to Pan: Gently transfer the milk mixture to the prepared pan. Smooth it out with a spatula to ensure even distribution.</li>
                    <li>Cool and Set: Allow the mixture to cool and set in the pan.</li>
                    <li>Finish with Latik: Once set, brush the top with coconut oil and garnish with latik.</li>
                    <li>Serve: Cut into serving slices and enjoy your Bibingkang Malagkit with Latik!</li>
